This is where I will write the integration testing once I learn how to test React correctly.
I have a few unit testing suites that just simply shallow mounts the components and makes sure they actually render
correctly. Without being able to make requests through Enzyme to the server to sign in I won't be able to do proper
testing. This is definitely at the top of my "things to learn" list and I will study into this further when I have more time.
